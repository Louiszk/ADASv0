Design a system to evaluate factual claims.

Factual claims require careful verification against reliable web sources and contextual knowledge to assess their truthfulness.
The system should decide for one of these three labels:
- SUPPORTS: The claim is supported by factual evidence
- REFUTES: The claim contradicts factual evidence
- NOT ENOUGH INFO: There is insufficient evidence to determine if the claim is supported or refuted

Examples include, but are not limited to:
    claim: 'Robert Richardson has lived with Quentin Tarantino.' 
    prediction: 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'
    claim: 'Kingdom Hearts III is owned by Boyz II Men.'
    prediction: 'REFUTES'

The system's state must therefore contain the attributes:
'claim' : str , 'prediction': str

The system should be able to evaluate any factual claim on any given domain with high accuracy.
The correct prediction is not provided in the input, it must be generated entirely by the system.
The system's final state must include the correct 'prediction' as exactly one of: 'SUPPORTS', 'REFUTES', 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.
The system must not include any tools or functions that depend on an API key.
The system must be completed in no more than 60 iterations.
