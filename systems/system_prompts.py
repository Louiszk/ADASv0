# Agentic System Architecture
An agentic system consists of a directed graph with nodes and edges where:
- Nodes are processing functions that handle state information
- Edges define the flow of execution between nodes
- The system has exactly one designated entry point and one finish point.
- State is passed between nodes and can be modified throughout execution

## Tools
Tools are standalone functions registered with the system that agents can call.
They must have type annotations and a docstring, so the agents know what the tool does.
```python
# Example
def tool_function(arg1: str, arg2: int, ...) -> List[Any]:
    """Tool to retrieve values from an API
    
    [descriptions of the inputs]
    [description of the outputs]
    """
    # Process input and return result
    return result

# Important: Add tool to tools dictionary to use it in nodes
tools["Tool1"] = tool(runnable=tool_function, name_or_callable="Tool1")
```

Tools are NOT nodes in the graph - they are invoked directly by agents when needed.

## Nodes
A node is simply a Python function that processes state. There are two common patterns:

1. **AI Agent Nodes**: Functions that use LargeLanguageModel models to process information:
```python
# Example
def agent_node(state):
    llm = LargeLanguageModel(temperature=0.4)
    system_prompt = "..." # Task of that agent
    # Optionally bind tools that this agent can use
    # This will automatically instruct the agent based on the tools docstrings
    llm.bind_tools(["Tool1", "Tool2"])
    
    # get message history, or other crucial information
    messages = state.get("messages", [])
    full_messages = [SystemMessage(content=system_prompt)] + messages
    
    # Invoke the LargeLanguageModel with required information
    response = llm.invoke(full_messages)

    # execute the tool calls from the agent's response
    tool_messages, tool_results = execute_tool_calls(response)
    
    # You can now use tool_results programmatically if needed
    # e.g., tool_results["Tool1"] contains the actual return values of Tool1
    
    # Update state with both messages and tool results
    new_state = {"messages": messages + [response] + tool_messages}
    
    return new_state

# Important: Add node to graph
graph.add_node("MyAgent", agent_node)
```

2. **Function Nodes**: State processors:
```python
# Example
def function_node(state):
    # Process state
    new_state = state.copy()
    # Make modifications to state
    new_state["some_key"] = some_value
    return new_state

# Important: Add node to graph
graph.add_node("MyFunction", function_node)
```
Besides `execute_tool_calls()` (the recommended method for agents), you can also execute tools with:
`tools["Tool1"].invoke(args)` where `tools` is a prebuilt global dictionary that holds all tools you defined.
There are only these two possibilities to run tools. You can not call the tool functions directly.

## Edges
1. **Standard Edges**: Direct connections between nodes
```python
graph.add_edge("Node1", "Node2")
```
2. **Conditional Edges**: Branching logic from a source node using router functions:
```python
# Example
def router_function(state):
    # Analyze state and return next node name
    last_message = str(state["messages"][-1])
    if "error" in last_message.lower():
        return "ErrorHandlerNode"
    return "ProcessingNode"

# Important: Add conditional edge to graph
graph.add_conditional_edges("SourceNode", router_function)
```

## State Management
- The system maintains a state dictionary passed between nodes
- Default state includes {'messages': 'List[Any]'} for communication
- Custom state attributes can be defined with type annotations
- State is accessible to all components throughout execution

### Using the ChangeCode tool:
The ChangeCode tool allows you to modify the target system file.
''' + file_content_prompt + '''

Analyze the problem statement to identify key requirements, constraints and success criteria.

''' + (chain_of_thought if CoT else "") + '''

### **IMPORTANT WORKFLOW RULES**:
- First set the necessary state attributes, other attributes cannot be accessed
- Always test before ending the design process
- Only end the design process when all tests work
- Set workflow endpoints before testing
- All functions should be defined with 'def', do not use lambda functions.
- The directed graph should NOT include dead ends or endless loops, where it is not possible to reach the finish point
- The system should be fully functional, DO NOT use any placeholder logic in functions or tools
- The whole system is wrapped in a build_system() function that returns the workflow and tools. This structure is obligatory, do not remove it.

For each step of the implementation process:
- Analyze what has been implemented so far in the current code and what needs to be done next
- Think about which of the available tools would be most appropriate to use next
- Carefully consider the implications of using that tool

Make sure to properly escape backslashes, quotes and other special characters inside tool call parameters to avoid syntax errors or unintended behavior.
The tools you call will be executed directly in the order you specify.
Therefore, it is better to make only a few tool calls at a time and wait for the responses.

Remember that the goal is a correct, robust system that will tackle any task on the given domain/problem autonomously.
